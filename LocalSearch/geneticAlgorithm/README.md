# Genetic Algorithms
### here we want to show usage of genetic algorithm . we want to have an agent that solve password_game efficiently .
### first code is the password game without ai agent and the second code contains agent 

## password game : 
### in this game you shoud guess a password , in each step you guess 7 passwords then when you submit them , you will see the number of correct characters for each submission .

## ai_generation :
### in second code you can have ai generating password for each steps after you click on generat then you can submit , and you can do it automaticly 


## color explanation : 
### we use green and red color for highlight next population parents . green color for first parent and red color for second parent . you can also see the parent of each population in the top.
### for each character of a guess : if it comes from the first parent it will be green if it from second parent it will be red and if its from mutation it will be blue
### you can also change mutation rate by the slider
